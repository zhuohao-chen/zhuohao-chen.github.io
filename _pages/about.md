I am a Master’s student in Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue University. My research focuses on Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and Extended Reality (XR), especially adaptive user interfaces, cognitive and behavioral responses in mixed reality, and the use of generative AI for game character design.

I have co-authored publications in HCI and game research, including a systematic review of generative AI in game character creation (IEEE Transactions on Games, 2024) and work on predictive graphical displays under time delay (HCI International, 2023). Currently, I am a co-first author on a submission to IEEE VR/TVCG investigating perception and avoidance behavior in outdoor MR environments.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Changsha University of Science and Technology, where I led a student game development lab and founded the university’s first game design competition. I have received national awards in VR/game design competitions and continue to pursue my vision of building immersive virtual worlds—aspiring to create experiences as engaging as the Oasis in Ready Player One.
